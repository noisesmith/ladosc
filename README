TO INSTALL:

If you are running ubuntu gutsy, you should be able to copy the op.so
and osc.so files from src/ into a directory that is in your
LADSPA_PATH and proceed on with looking at the documentation in your
favorite html browser.

Otherwise, you need to build from source.

If you are building from source:

You will need: The ladspa.h header file, and the liblo library.

Edit src/Makefile for the location of your liblo.a static library, and
the directory where you want to install the plugins (the defaults
should work for a majority of users).

In the src/ directory, run make. Install is the default target.
